<h2>AKA Scott McGrath</h2>
<p>
On the Internet, I go by Scrawlon. It's short, memorable and has that cool "hacker"
vibe -- like Neo, Count Zero or Mr. Robot -- Scrawlon is the unknown cyberpunk
hero on the other side of your computer screen...

<ul class="social-networks">
  {% assign social_networks = site.owner.social_networks %}

  {% for social_network in social_networks %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{social_network.url}}" title="{{social_network.name}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

      </a>

  {% endfor %}
</ul>

  Back in the real world, they call me Scott. I'm no hacker, but I do write
  code. Professionally, 40 hours a week at

  I'm proud of that work, but the drive
  to learn and create doesn't end at the office door. Programming is as much
  art as profession. Recent personal projects include --

  When I'm not grinding out code for some active side venture,
  I'm reading docs, scouring my Twitter feed, experimenting on CodePen,
  hustling to stay current with the latest web languages and frameworks.
